	二十五、幽默被公正地誉为最佳诗才。托卡莱尔
　　即日我玩的真欣喜，然而我有点可惜，没有见到金龟和水鸟，希望下次来能见到她们。
　　厥后，后知后觉，属于本人的影子早仍旧在时间里弥漫，时间急遽，我未然记不清开初为你猖獗的相貌，只牢记谁人芳华时间的你，从来在眼眸窜动，再有谁人腾跃在芳华戏台上的精神，从来在。
But still lonely, right?
In every man in the corner of the feast lit a cigarette and unloaded costumes excessive magnificence washed moments in every woman.
Lonely, and became an abrupt wounds, luxuriant and silence, exquisite and pale.
I always think she is the most perfect girl in the world, and I was naturally made.
Can be completely change everything for her words, and I don't know lost her alive still have what meaning for me.
A person walking in the street, blankly aimlessly, passers-by footsteps in a hurry, still nobody noticed my hiatus.
Done, and I don't live without her, I want to leave this world, I will die.
